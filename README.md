mCourseINFS3605

Hey Everyone, so this is the repo for our code base so far. It's an Android app. 

Functionality (Ill add/remove items as we go through development):
  Account Creation
  Profile Creation
  Login
  User Profile Viewing

How to Install:
  1. Open up Android Studio.
  2. If there is no project open you want to click on the option "Check out from Version Control"
  3. A drop then menu appears, from it select "Git"
  4. A prompt will ask you for a URL and where you want to clone the repo
  5. This "https://github.com/Fhy40/mCourseINFS3605.git" is the URL but you can find it on this page under "Clone or Download"
  6. Click on clone after specifying a location
  7. It will say "Checkout From Version Control?" click on "Yes"
  8. WAIT, it takes like a crazy long time for the whole thing to index for some reason. Just wait till it's completely done loading.
  9. If it asks you to add anything to Git just click cancel
  10. And then just click on the green arrow at the top to run it on your phone or emulator.

Once you run the app you should see a login page with a sign-up button at the bottom. Give it a whirl. There are a few rules like make the email something reasonable, prefferably let it end with @gmail.com. Don't make the password too short. See how things go and try and break it.
