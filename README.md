To install this application first download all necessary files through github. Once you have all files ready, open the folder in Android Studio.
Run the application through an emulator or a device. In its current state only login is functional. The Sign Up function has been tweaked to only affect a single
account. Once the last stages of profile creation are complete we will re-enable this option so that any user can create an account.
